# 8-Week Road Cycling Training Program - Design Document

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Program Name:** 8-Week Road Builder
**Target Audience:** Intermediate cyclists (5-7 hrs/week baseline)
**Primary Goals:** Improve VO2max, FTP/threshold power, aerobic endurance, and overall cycling performance

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Training Approach: Polarized Training (80/20)

Based on 2020-2024 research showing that polarized training optimally develops all physiological systems:

- **80% Low Intensity (Z1-Z2):** Builds aerobic base, mitochondrial density, fat oxidation
- **15-20% High Intensity (Z4-Z5):** Develops VO2max, FTP, lactate tolerance
- **<5% Moderate Intensity (Z3):** Minimal tempo/sweet spot work

### Key Research Foundations

**Polarized Training Distribution (2022-2024)**
- Systematic reviews confirm polarized and non-polarized training yield comparable VO2max gains when volume is matched
- Elite athletes naturally adopt 80/20 distribution
- Hard days very hard, easy days very easy - no "gray zone" training

**VO2max Development (2024)**
- Higher fraction of VO2max during intervals correlates with greater performance gains
- Low cadence high-intensity (50-70 RPM) shows superior aerobic improvements
- Protocols: 4x4min, 5x8min, micro-intervals (30/30, 40/20)

**Threshold Durability (2022-2024)**
- Time-at-threshold (TAT) as important as absolute FTP
- Progressive loading: 24min → 40min over 8 weeks
- Over/under intervals improve lactate clearance at 80-110% threshold

**Lactate Dynamics (2020-2024)**
- Oscillating intensity prevents plateau, maintains engagement
- Active recovery at 80-90% FTP optimizes lactate clearance

## 3. Workout Progressions

### Tuesday - VO2max & High-Intensity

**Progression Logic:** Variety across proven protocols, no repeats

| Week | Workout | Structure | Focus |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 30/30s | 3 x (8 x 30sec @ 120% / 30sec @ 50%) | Micro-interval introduction |
| 2 | 40/20s | 3 x (10 x 40sec @ 120% / 20sec @ 50%) | Extended work, short recovery |
| 3 | 4x4min | 4 x 4min @ 110% (4min recovery) | Sustained VO2max |
| 4 | 30/30s Recovery | 2 x (8 x 30/30 @ 120%) | Reduced volume |
| 5 | 5x8min | 5 x 8min @ 95% (4min recovery) | Long threshold intervals |
| 6 | Low Cadence VO2 | 4 x 4min @ 110% @ 60rpm (4min recovery) | Neuromuscular + aerobic |
| 7 | Mixed Protocol | 2 x (8 x 40/20 @ 120% + 3min @ 110%) | Combined stimulus |
| 8 | Taper 30/30s | 2 x (6 x 30/30 @ 120%) | Maintain sharpness |

**Total Duration:** 60-80 minutes including warmup/cooldown

### Wednesday - Recovery Ride (8 Options)

Athlete chooses based on fatigue level and preference:

1. **Easy Z1:** 45min @ 50-60% FTP - pure recovery
2. **With Sprints:** 45min @ 55-65% + 5x10sec sprints - neuromuscular maintenance
3. **High Cadence:** 45min @ 100-110rpm @ 60% - leg speed
4. **Low Cadence:** 45min @ 60-70rpm @ 65% - muscular endurance
5. **Cadence Mix:** Alternate 5min high/low @ 60% - varied stimulus
6. **Micro-bursts:** 45min @ 55% + 8x(30sec @ 75% / 90sec @ 55%) - light stimulation
7. **Rest:** Skip if fatigued - optional day
8. **Easy + Stretch:** 30min @ 55% + 15min mobility - combined recovery

### Friday - Threshold Work (Progressive Time-At-Threshold)

**Progression Logic:** Build sustained power from 24min → 40min

| Week | Workout | Structure | Time-at-Threshold |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Cruise Intervals | 4 x 6min @ 95% (3min recovery) | 24min |
| 2 | Over/Unders | 3 x (3min @ 95% / 2min @ 105% / 3min @ 95%) | 24min + surges |
| 3 | Progressive Build | 3 x 10min (start @ 90%, build to 98%) | 30min |
| 4 | Sweet Spot | 2 x 12min @ 88% (5min recovery) | 24min (recovery) |
| 5 | Threshold + Surges | 4 x (8min @ 95% + 1min @ 110%) | 32min + surges |
| 6 | Extended Over/Unders | 2 x (5min @ 92% / 3min @ 102% / 5min @ 92%) | 26min + surges |
| 7 | Low Cadence 2x20 | 2 x 20min @ 88% @ 65rpm (6min recovery) | **40min (peak)** |
| 8 | FTP Test/Validation | 1 x 20min @ 100% OR 2 x 15min @ 98% | Assessment |

**Total Duration:** 65-90 minutes including warmup/cooldown

**Rationale:** Progressive overload for athletes with punchy/explosive strength but limited threshold endurance. Variety (over/unders, surges, progressive builds) maintains engagement while systematically building durability.

| 5-7 | 75min | 65-75% FTP |
| 8 | 60min | 65-75% FTP (taper) |

**Purpose:** Additional aerobic volume without fatigue accumulation

### Sunday - Long Endurance

| Week | Duration | Intensity | Purpose |

## 5. Nutrition Guidelines

### Pre-Workout

**High Intensity Days (Tuesday/Friday):**
- 1-2g carbs/kg bodyweight 2-3 hours before
- Example (70kg rider): 70-140g carbs
- Options: Oatmeal, banana, toast, rice, pasta

**Easy/Endurance Days:**
- Normal meal, no special loading
- Avoid fasted state for rides >90min

### During Workout

| Duration | Carbs/Hour | Fluid/Hour | Notes |
|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| <60min | 0g (water only) | 500-750ml | Electrolytes if hot |
| 60-90min | 30-40g | 500-750ml | Z2-Z3 rides |
| >90min OR high intensity | 60-90g | 500-750ml | Mix drinks + gels/chews/bars |

### Post-Workout Recovery

**Within 30-60 minutes:**
- 20-40g protein
- Carbs at 3:1 or 4:1 carb:protein ratio
- Examples: Recovery shake, chocolate milk, meal

**High intensity sessions:**
- Prioritize glycogen replenishment (higher carb intake)

### Recovery Weeks (Week 4 & 8)

- Maintain carb intake despite lower volume
- Increase protein: 1.6-2.0g/kg/day
- Focus on anti-inflammatory foods: berries, fatty fish, leafy greens
- Prioritize sleep (9+ hours)

### General Hydration

- Daily baseline: 30-40ml/kg bodyweight
- Monitor urine color (pale yellow = optimal)
- Pre-ride: 500ml 2 hours before
- Post-ride: 150% of fluid lost (weigh before/after if possible)

## 6. Recovery & Fatigue Management

### Fatigue Warning Signs

**Check daily/weekly:**
- Elevated resting heart rate (+5-10 bpm above baseline)
- Difficulty hitting power targets on easy rides
- Poor sleep quality for 2+ consecutive nights
- Persistent muscle soreness beyond 48 hours
- Mood changes (irritability, low motivation)
- Decreased appetite

### Fatigue Protocol

**Minor Fatigue:**
1. Skip Wednesday recovery ride
2. Extend Thursday rest (light walk/stretch only)

**Moderate Fatigue:**
1. Convert Friday threshold to easy Z2 ride (60min)
2. Reduce Sunday endurance by 25%

**Significant Fatigue:**
1. Take 2-3 complete rest days
2. Resume with easy week (Week 4 structure)
3. Reassess life stress, sleep, nutrition

**Chronic Fatigue (>1 week):**
1. Stop training completely
2. Consult coach or physician
3. Potential overtraining syndrome

### Recovery Optimization

**Sleep:**
- Target: 8-9 hours during build weeks
- Target: 9+ hours during recovery weeks
- Sleep quality > quantity
- Consistent sleep/wake times

**Stress Management:**
- High life stress = reduce training intensity by 10-15%
- Work/family stress counts as training stress
- Consider meditation, breathing exercises

**Illness Protocol:**
- Fever or systemic symptoms: Skip all workouts
- Minor cold (above neck): Light Z1 only if feeling ok
- Return gradually: 1-2 easy days before resuming plan

**Soreness vs. Pain:**
- Muscle fatigue/soreness: Normal, ok to train
- Joint/tendon pain: Warning sign, reduce volume/intensity
- Sharp pain: Stop immediately, seek medical advice

### Weekly Recovery Checklist

- [ ] Sleep 8-9 hours per night
- [ ] Recovery rides kept truly easy (<65% FTP)
- [ ] Two complete rest days (Thu + Mon)
- [ ] Post-workout nutrition within 60min
- [ ] Foam rolling or stretching 2-3x per week
- [ ] Resting heart rate within 5 bpm of baseline
- [ ] Feeling motivated and ready for hard days

### Recovery Week Strategy (Weeks 4 & 8)

**Volume:** Reduced by 35-40%
**Intensity:** Maintained (intervals shorter, not easier)
**Focus Areas:**
- Extra sleep (aim for 9+ hours)
- Nutrition quality (whole foods, anti-inflammatory)
- Life balance (reduce non-training stress)
- Light cross-training ok (yoga, swimming, walking)
- Mental refresh (read, socialize, explore new routes)

**Goal:** Return to build weeks feeling refreshed, not depleted
